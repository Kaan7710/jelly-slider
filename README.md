## 📌 What is jelly-slider?

jelly-slider is a smooth and interactive slider you can use on your computer. It looks like a piece of jelly that moves and bounces as you slide it. The effect is made with modern web graphics technology, so it runs smoothly and looks nice in your web browser.

You don't need any special skills to use it. It runs in popular browsers like Chrome and Edge that support a feature called WebGPU. This lets the slider move and animate quickly.

## 🧑‍💻 How Does It Work?

The jelly-slider uses the power of WebGPU, a new web technology that lets websites render complex graphics fast. This lets the slider “feel” like jelly, bouncing and flexing as you move it.

It uses real-time physics and shading (making shadows and highlights) to create a fun, fluid effect. The code is built with Next.js and React, common tools for making modern websites.
